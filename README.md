# Final-Project

**Exploratory Data Analysis**

Cleaning process:

- Prepare data (cleaning and enriching)

    - Add new information (trip distance, duration, start district, end district, trip cost)

- Upload data to SQL

Query database to plot and visualize:

- Yearly trips (Time Series)
- Start and end points with Heatmap, allowing user to choose periods
- Citi Bike Stations in New York (Map Plot)
- Most used Stations
- Bikes Data (Electric vs. Classic, Most used bikes, etc.)
- Membership Analysis (Revenue Stream, Pie Chart, Subsidies, etc.)
- Trip distance and duration (correlation)

- Try to obtain most common routes (some Google Maps resource to calculate possible routes from A to B, bike rails available) to plot heatmaps and suggest potential bike rail improvements.

**Predictive Data Analysis**

Use data to develop some models that are useful to:

- Predict trip real duration from user's initial location and desired destination (using user start and end location, and time input) 
    
    - Take into account distance to closest station, bike availability, closest station to end point, availability, etc.)


- Suggest operation routes ro relocate bikes among stations.

- Predict short term specific station availability and general use rate for Citi system.
